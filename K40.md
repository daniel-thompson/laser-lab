K40 Laser Cutter/Engraver
=========================

Preparation and safety checks
-----------------------------

1.  Turn the laptop on
2.  Hook the extractor hose to the door frame
3.  Check work area is clear and determine location of safety equipment
    (emergency stop, fire extinguisher, etc.)
4.  Ensure the Laser Switch is in the up position
5.  Use key to reset the emergency stop (and remove key) and turn on the
    laser cutter
6.  Check the extractor hose is attached at the laser cutter end and
    that there is air flow at the exhaust
7.  Check the coolant is circulating correctly by checking flow through
    return tubing
8.  Locate appropriate eye protection

Laser arming
------------

1.  Lay material on the cutting bed
2.  Load the artwork and open the *Engrave* dialog
3.  Select the desired cut type (*Engraving* or *Cutting*)
4.  Select an appropriate speed of head movement
5.  Check *Refer-X* and *Refer-Y* is set correctly to place the cutting head
    on the top-left of the material
6.  Turn on the pump for the air assist
7.  Wear eye protection
8.  Arm the laser and click *Starting*
9.  Repeat from #2 for any further layers.
10. When complete, disarm the laser and turn off the air assist

Finishing up
------------

1.  Wait until the extractor has cleared all smoke from inside the
    machine.
2.  If you have been working at high power for a sustained period allow
    extra time for the coolant to circulate.
3.  Turn the laser cutter off
4.  Tidy up the extractor hose
5.  Turn off the laptop.
   - Do **not** use the Power button for this; putting the laptop into
     Standby will drain the battery when the machine is not in use.
   - To fully power off you must pull up the power sub-menu (to the right
     of the power symbol) and select *Shut Down*.
6.  Cut the power using the Emergency Stop

Power/speed settings
--------------------

### Quick settings

 * Acrylic, 2mm: Raster #3@200mm/s, Engrave #5@40mm/s, Cut #12@12mm/s
 * Acrylic, 3mm: Raster #3@200mm/s, Engrave #5@40mm/s, Cut #12@10mm/s
 * Card, 160gsm: Engrave #-2@50mm/s, Cut #1@50mm/s
 * Plywood, 3mm: Raster #-1@200mm/s, Engrave #0@40mm/s, Cut #10@8mm/s
 * Plywood, 4mm: Raster #-1@200mm/s, Engrave #0@40mm/s, Cut #12@8mm/s

### Plywood

Plywood reacts well to varying the laser power and speed to choose
different degrees of darkening and depth.

200mm/s raster engraving allows very low laser powers to be used:

 * At #-2 there is a subtle tinting of the wood, with little or no
   engraving depth.
 * At #-1 there is light browning and an engraving depth of 0.6mm.
 * At #0 the wood takes a dark brown colour with varnishing of the
   surrounding area; 1.0mm engraving depth

40mm/s vector engraving also requires very low laser power.

 * At #-2 there may be no effect on the wood at all!
 * At #-1 the engraving is dark brown and have a noticeable depth
 * At #0 lines are fully black and etched deeply into the wood

Raster engraving
----------------

Raster engraving can run the head at up to 300mm/s; running beyond this
speed risks mis-stepping.

"Sunken" should normally be checked; it means the laser will be engaged
for the black parts of the image resulting in the engraved image being
sunk into the material. Turning this option off will reverse this, turning
the laser off for the black portions of the image.

Vector engraving and cutting
----------------------------

Vector operation can run the cutting head at up to 50mm/s without risk
of mis-stepping.

Even when engraving the software must be set for "Cutting"; "Engraving"
will interpret the diagram is raster form rather than the desired vector
form.
